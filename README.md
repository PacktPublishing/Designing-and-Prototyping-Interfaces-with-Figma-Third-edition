Figma has evolved, and so should your workflow. In this fully updated third edition of _Designing and Prototyping Interfaces with Figma_, you will explore the platform’s most powerful additions, including Variables, Conditional Prototyping, and a redesigned interface that reshapes how you work. This edition is built around a new, real-world project that takes you from brief to handoff and anchors every concept in practical, day-to-day design tasks.</br>
Across the project, you will create responsive layouts with Auto Layout, components, and variants; build scalable design systems; and prototype realistic, branched flows with conditional interactions. You will test on devices, collect feedback, and iterate with confidence, applying patterns and checklists that translate directly to team workflows and real product constraints.</br>
Collaboration gets equal focus. You will learn how Dev Mode bridges the work of designers and developers for a smoother, more structured handoff with clear specs and variable-aware inspection. The book closes with a pragmatic look at emerging AI-powered tools, helping you evaluate where they might add value without replacing your creative judgment. Whether you are new to UI/UX design or sharpening your practice, you will come away with a proven workflow to ship adaptive, production-ready designs.
